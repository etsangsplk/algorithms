# Delete Middle to Last

Consider the following linked list.

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

Given a reference to a node that is neither the first nor the last
element of the list, remove the element from the list.  For example,
when given a reference to 3, the result is the following list.

```
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
```
