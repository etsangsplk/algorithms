Identify whether four sides (given by four integers) can form a
square, a rectangle or neither. 

# Input

Each line of input describes a single polygon and contains four
space-separated integers, which represent the length of the sides of
the polygon.  The input  lines will follow the 'A B C D' order as in
the following representation. 


|------A------|
|             |
|             |
D             B
|             |
|             |
|------C------|

The four integers representing the sides will be such that
-2000<=X<=2000, where X is the integer.

# Output

A single line which contains 3 sppace-separated integers, representing
the number of squares, number of rectangles and number of other
polygons with 4 sides.
