# Escape Spaces

Replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the
string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional
characters.  You will be given the length of the text within the
string.  You may only perform the operation in place.

Example:

**Input**
```
"a cool car    "
10
```

**Output**
```
"a%20cool%20car"
```
