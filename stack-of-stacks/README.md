# Stack of Stacks

Your task is to build a stack for a huge amount of elements such that
every `m` elements behave "like" a stack.  The only operation each
sub-stack offers is __pop__.  Remove each sub-stack when it becomes
empty.  Do not shift elements between sub-stacks.  Your stack of
stacks must offer at least __push__ and __pop__.
